# Data Cleaning with Python (Pandas and NumPy)

This repository contains code and examples for data cleaning using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The focus is on cleaning datasets to ensure they are ready for further analysis, including handling missing values, data type conversions, and string manipulation.
For more details on data cleaning, check out the excellent article on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/#cleaning-the-entire-dataset-using-the-applymap-function).

## Overview

Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis and data scientist pipeline. This repository provides various techniques to clean datasets, particularly focusing on:

- Removing or filling missing values.
- Converting data types.
- String manipulation (e.g., replacing characters, extracting substrings).
- Identifying and handling outliers.
- Using efficient methods for cleaning large datasets.

## Requirements
